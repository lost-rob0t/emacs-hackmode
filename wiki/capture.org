#+title: Hackmode Capture

* Hackmode Capture
help:hackmode-capture is a simple wrapper around help:org-capture.
Set help:hackmode-capture-templates to add your own templates.

The default file is operations.org. The templates make use of org properties to make org tables with it.

A good use for this is to use the scripts capture to slowly repast your bash commands into a recon script in a litterate manner in org, then tangle the whole file to a script.
