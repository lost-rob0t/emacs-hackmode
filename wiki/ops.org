#+TITLE: Ops


* Operations
In hackmode an operation is a directory where you store notes and scan output.

Operations live in your [[help:hackmode-dir][hackmode-dir]], if you create an operation outside that directory it will be symlinked to your current directory.

** Usage
+ You can create an operation with [[help:hackmode-init][hackmode-init]].
+ You can switch to an operation with [[help:hackmode-switch-op][hackmode-switch-op]].
+ You can go to the directory with [[help:hackmode-goto-operation][hackmode-goto-operation]].

** Vars

+ path to where operations are stored [[help:hackmode-dir][hackmode-dir]].
+ current operation [[help:hackmode-operation][hackmode-operation]].

+ hook ran when operation loaded [[help:hackmode-operation-hook][hackmode-operation-hook]].
  By default hook is just loading the lootfile and navigating to the current ~[[help:hackmode-operation][hackmode-operation]].
