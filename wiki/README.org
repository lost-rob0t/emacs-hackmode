* README
Long story short hackmode is a set of scripts to help you manage and run pentesting/bug bounty engagements. At the core of it is the concept of an operation, which is just a working directory where you work in.
other ideas for the mode include a listing of assets and findings. This is a Work in progress package, where stuff is added as i find a use for something.

Also see the [[https://github.com/lost-rob0t/hackmode][complementary common lisp version]].
