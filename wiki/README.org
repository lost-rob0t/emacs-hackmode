#+TITLE: Hackmode Wiki

* Overview
hackmode is a comprehensive Emacs package designed to streamline penetration testing workflows by providing integrated tools for operation management, asset tracking, and automation - all from within your favorite editor.

At its core is the concept of an *operation* - a structured workspace for each engagement with isolated environments, organized files, and integrated tooling.

** Current Features
- *Operation Management*: Create and switch between different pentesting engagements with isolated workspaces
- *Asset Tracking*: BBRF (Bug Bounty Reconnaissance Framework) integration for managing targets, domains, IPs, and URLs
- *File Upload Helper*: Generate wget/curl commands for easy file transfers to target systems
- *Target Management*: Keep track of current targets with completion and easy switching
- *Checklist Integration*: Copy and manage methodology checklists per target
- *Searchsploit Integration*: Browse and search exploit database from within Emacs
- *Capture System*: Structured note-taking and command capture
- *Environment Integration*: Automatic environment variable setup for proper isolation
- *Auto-completion*: Enhanced completion for hackmode commands and targets


** Planned Features *(needs cleanup)*
Several additional features are in development and need refinement:
- Workflow automation system
- Advanced tool integration interfaces
- Backend automation scripts (currently nextflow, maybe startintel)
- Enhanced BBRF command completion
- Target autocomplete
- eshell integration with tooling.
- More transient menus for common tools (not even started yet)

** Quick Start
1. Create an operation: =M-x hackmode-menu= â†’ =c= (Create operation)
2. Add targets: =M-x hackmode-add-target=
3. Set current target: =M-x hackmode-select-target=
4. Use checklists: =M-x hackmode-use-checklist=
