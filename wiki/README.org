Long story short hackmode is a set of scripts to helpo manage and run pentesting engagements. At the core of it is the concept of an operation, which is just a working directory where you work in.
There  is a complentary hackmode for common lisp, there hasnt been much work in that. Goal with the common lisp version is to enable support of hackmode in lish, nyxt and lem. Maybe i can communicate to that from emacs?
other ideas for the mode include a listing of assets and findings. This is a Work in progress package, where stuff is added as i find a use for something.
