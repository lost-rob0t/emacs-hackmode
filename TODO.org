#+title: Todo
* TODO make more snippets
* TODO Use a certail file for listing out all operations, so TRAMP can be supported
Currently the dumb way i do things is throw all the ops into a dir, in reality it would be simpler to just read and write a A-list/plist or even a sqlite database.
UIt would be nice to use a remote host uinstead of the local vm.
